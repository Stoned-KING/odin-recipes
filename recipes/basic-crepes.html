        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>crepe, also spelled crêpe, French pancake made of a thin batter containing flour, eggs, melted butter, salt, milk, water, and, if the crepes are to be served with a sweet sauce or garnish, sugar. Crepes can be filled with a variety of sweet or savoury mixtures. For crepes suzette the crepes are folded in four and soaked in a syrup flavoured with orange liqueur, and frequently are flamed at table.</p>

        <p>The word crêpe is derived from crispa, Latin for “curly.”</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
            <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
